# Project Title

**Description**:  This is a dotnet application created as part of the graduate program Paducah Fitness Center web application project.
This was built using detailed conceptual model of what a typical fitness company user requirements are, and what are all the entities envolved. 
You will find lot of details on program structures, model building concepts by reading through all the codes.

Some important things to note:

  - **Technology stack**: .NET, blazor.
  - **Status**:  This was built at around 2015/2016 and all the packages most likely be outdated. The purpose of this repo is to share the application development process, and how the backend and frontend development works. 
  - **Links to production or demo instances** There is no production live instance for this application. You are free to update this repo and develop your own modified application.
  - **What sets this apart from related-projects**  This is a unique project that are typically assigned to graduate information technology students, and this gives a good overview about documentation of user-requirements, detailed overview of conceptual/logical/physical model creation, and implementation of completed project.
